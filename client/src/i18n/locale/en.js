        education: 'Campus Assistance',
        educationDesc: 'Bringing water, helping classmates solve problems, repairing brooms for other classes â€“ campus life is full of mutual help among students. These seemingly insignificant actions invisibly build relationships among students and promote collective progress and unity. The "TokenX" platform allows us to leave traces of mutual assistance among students and record every act of volunteerism in their files.',
        tooling: 'Token Incentive',
        toolingDesc: 'The platform creates digital tokens, TX, which circulate among students through mutual assistance. For example, asking a classmate to help move books to the dormitory can give 1 TX as a record, while helping to explain a math problem can earn 0.5 TX. Taking circulating TX tokens as a carrier can naturally encourage students\' enthusiasm to help others.',
        ecosystem: 'Virtuous Cycle',
        ecosystemDesc: 'Mutual help and trading TX token points effectively improve participation. The platform records and displays students\' performance in real time, providing parents with a way to instantly understand their children\'s performance at school. This system establishes a healthier and more efficient interaction platform between students, parents, and schools.',
        community: 'Transparent Interaction',
        communityDesc: 'In this system, students and parents can jointly see the students\' growth and progress, no longer relying on the one-way feedback from the head teacher. This two-way communication improves information transparency, allowing students to be more self-disciplined under the joint attention of home and school, forming a positive cycle.',
        support: 'Comprehensive Development',
        supportDesc: 'Starting from a simple idea, the "TokenX" platform, jointly developed by students and teachers, truly puts the spirit of campus mutual assistance and the needs of home-school communication into practice. This not only solves the existing pain points of campus mutual assistance and home-school communication, but also promotes the comprehensive development of students\' character.',
